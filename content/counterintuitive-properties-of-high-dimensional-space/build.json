  "description": "Our geometric intuition developed in our three-dimensional world often fails us in higher dimensions. In this post I describe just a few phenomena of high dimensions, including escaping spheres, concentration of measure, and kissing numbers. All of these properties can be illustrated using basic mathematics.",
